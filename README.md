TI have a dataset with measurements of temperature and precipitation for 655 cities in Brazil, under both present and future climate.

I am looking for an experienced R/Shiny developer to create a Shiny app that provides a dynamic way to visualize this data.

Specifically, what I need to be done on the Shiny app:

* Show a “leaflet“ map of Brazil displaying all 655 cities as circles so that users can click one location;

* Once the location is clicked, all the data for that location is retrieved from the data table and plotted as bar graphs like for example the plots on this website: https://www.snap.uaf.edu/sites/all/modules/snap_community_charts/charts.php#baseline=cru32&community=1146&dataset=1&scenario=rcp60&units=standard&variability=1.
